# Focusing sounds for Android #
I've written focusing sounds Android app mainly because of educational reasons. I have done the Focusing sounds app for Windows so I thought it would be a good idea to build the same app as my first project for Android.

## Reason of creating my first Focusing sounds Windows app ##

I used web-based apps that generate(or play) white noise sounds, that helps me and many other people to stay calm, relax or just focus. So I thought why not write app that will do the same thing locally on my computer when I haven't got Internet connection.
